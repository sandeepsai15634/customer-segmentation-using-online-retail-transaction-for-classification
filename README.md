 Abstract
 
 Customer segmentation plays a crucial role in marketing strategies aimed at improving customer satisfaction and maximizing profitability. In this study, we propose a methodology for customer segmentation utilizing online retail transaction data. The dataset comprises various features such as customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and transaction history. We employ logistic regression and random forest classification algorithms to classify customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing patterns. Logistic regression offers a simple yet effective approach for segmenting customers by modeling the probability of belonging to each segment, while random forest classification provides a robust framework for handling complex interactions between features and accurately predicting customer segments. We compare the performance of both algorithms in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we conduct feature importance analysis to identify the key factors driving customer segmentation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of logistic regression and random forest classification algorithms in accurately segmenting customers based on online retail transaction data, thereby enabling personalized marketing strategies and targeted customer engagement initiatives.

Introduction

Utilizing online retail transaction data for customer segmentation and classification is paramount for personalized marketing strategies. By analyzing purchasing behaviors, demographics, and browsing patterns, businesses can categorize customers into distinct segments, enabling targeted promotions and tailored experiences. This approach maximizes customer satisfaction and enhances business profitability by delivering relevant offerings to each segment, ultimately fostering long-term customer loyalty and retention.

Objective and goal of the project

To employ online retail transaction data for customer segmentation through classification techniques. Achieve accurate classification of customers into distinct segments based on their transaction behavior, enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.

Problem Statement

"Develop a classification model utilizing online retail transaction data for customer segmentation. The goal is to categorize customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior and demographic information, enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences."

About the dataset 
Description:
An automobile company has plans to enter new markets with their existing products (P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5). After intensive market research, they’ve deduced that the behavior of the new market is similar to their existing market.
In their existing market, the sales team has classified all customers into 4 segments (A, B, C, D ). Then, they performed segmented outreach and communication for a different segment of customers. This strategy has work e exceptionally well for them. They plan to use the same strategy for the new markets and have identified 2627 new potential customers.

Algorithm Used

Logistic regression
It is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary). Like all regression analyses, logistic regression is a predictive analysis. It is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.
A logistic regression model predicts a dependent data variable by analyzing the relationship between one or more existing independent variables. For example, a logistic regression could be used to predict whether a political candidate will win or lose an election or whether a high school student will be admitted or not to a particular college. These binary outcomes allow straightforward decisions between two alternatives.

Random forest
It is a commonly-used machine learning algorithm which combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach a single result. Its ease of use and flexibility have fueled its adoption, as it handles both classification and regression problems.
The random forest algorithm is an extension of the bagging method as it utilizes both bagging and feature randomness to create an uncorrelated forest of decision trees. Feature randomness, also known as feature bagging or “the random subspace method”(link resides outside ibm.com), generates a random subset of features, which ensures low correlation among decision trees. This is a key difference between decision trees and random forests. While decision trees consider all the possible feature splits, random forests only select a subset of those features.

Proposed Methodology

	Data Collection and Preprocessing

-	Collect transactional data from the online retail platform, including customer demographics (if available), purchase history, transaction timestamps, product details, etc.
-	Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Perform data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare the data for analysis.

	Feature Selection

-	Identify relevant features for customer segmentation such as frequency of purchases, monetary value of purchases, recency of purchases, product categories purchased, etc.
-	Use techniques like correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), or domain knowledge to select the most important features for segmentation.


	Customer Segmentation

-	Apply segmentation techniques such as RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value) analysis, K-means clustering, or hierarchical clustering to group customers based on their transactional behavior and other relevant features.
-	Generate customer segments/clusters that reflect meaningful patterns in the data and provide insights into customer behavior.

	Model Training

-	Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
-	Train logistic regression and random forest classification algorithms using the training data.
-	Tune hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or randomized search to optimize model performance.
	Model Evaluation
-	Evaluate the performance of logistic regression and random forest models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
-	Compare the performance of both models to identify the one that best fits the segmentation task.

	Customer Classification

-	Apply the trained models to classify customers into segments based on their transactional behavior and other relevant features.
-	Evaluate the effectiveness of the segmentation by analyzing the characteristics of each segment and their potential business implications.

	Validation and Iteration

-	Validate the segmentation results by comparing them with known customer profiles or through qualitative feedback from domain experts.
-	Iterate on the methodology, if necessary, by refining feature selection, adjusting model parameters, or exploring alternative segmentation techniques.

Results

Logistic regression is a linear classification algorithm commonly used for binary classification problems. In this case, it achieved a classification accuracy of 43%. This means that out of all the instances in your dataset, the logistic regression model correctly classified 43% of them into their respective customer segments.
Random forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes for classification problems. In this case, it achieved a classification accuracy of 40%. Similar to logistic regression, this means that the random forest model correctly classified 40% of the instances into their respective customer segments.

Conclusion

Analysis of online retail transaction data and applying logistic regression and random forest classification algorithms for customer segmentation, it can be concluded that both algorithms offer valuable insights into categorizing customers based on their transaction behaviors. Logistic regression provides a straightforward and interpretable model, suitable for understanding the influence of various features on customer segmentation. On the other hand, random forest classification offers higher accuracy and robustness in handling complex datasets with non-linear relationships between variables. Ultimately, the choice between these algorithms depends on the specific objectives of the segmentation task, the complexity of the dataset, and the desired balance between interpretability and predictive performance.
